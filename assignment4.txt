Q.

Complete the following tasks:
a. Design a Meal class with two fields—one that holds the name of the entrée, the other
that holds a calorie count integer. Include a constructor that sets a Meal’s fields with
parameters, or uses default values when no parameters are provided.
b. Include an overloaded insertion operator function that displays a Meal’s values.
c. Include an overloaded extraction operator that prompts a user for an entrée name and
calorie count for a meal.
d. Include an overloaded operator+()function that allows you to add two or more Meal
objects. Adding two Meal objects means adding their calorie values and creating a
summary Meal object in which you store “Daily Total” in the entrée field.



	Meal obj1("Pizza",5000),obj2("Burger",1000),obj3;
	cout<<"Input Obj 3:-\n";
	cin>>obj3;
	cout<<"\nDisplay Obj 1:-\n";
	cout<<obj1;
	cout<<"\nDisplay Obj 2:-\n";
	cout<<obj2;
	cout<<"\nDisplay Obj 3:-\n";
	cout<<obj3;
	cout<<"\nMeal Summary:-\n";
	cout<<obj1+obj2+obj3;
	
	
	o/p
	
	Display Obj 3:-
	Meal Name: Dosa
	Calories: 500

	Meal Summary:-
	Daily Total: Pizza, Burger, Dosa
	Calories: 6500
	
Q.	
	WAP to do the casting from one type to another (using operator overload)
	ex:
	1. class Rupee
	2. Class Doller
	3. user takes doller as input
	4. when obj of Rupee is assigned to obj of doller, conversion should happen
	5. when Robj.print() -> need to display the converted value
    
driver code:
		Doller d(10);
		Rupee r;
		r = d;
		d.print();
		r.print();
		
o/p
	10
	820 -> if conversionrate is 1 doller=82rs 
	
	

Q .

Write a program that uses class templates to search for a particular number in an array. 
It should display the number and the position at which the number is found. (The array size can be of your choice)
