	its not deleting/calling dtor of drived class
	its only deleting base class
	As base is just a wrapper arround drived class
	it has to first delete the d class then b
	This can be acheived by virtual dtor
	add virtual keyword in based dtor 
	virtual ~B(){ cout<<"Dtor of Base"<<endl; }
	o/p
	Ctor of Base
	Ctor of Drived
	Dtor of Drived
	Dtor of Base

	hence memory leak is avoided, but increased
	the size of base class due to vptr->vtable
